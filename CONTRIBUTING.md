# Contributing to NixPHP

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **NixPHP** – a lightweight PHP microframework built for simplicity and flexibility. 🙌

Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request — you're welcome here.

## 🧠 Philosophy

NixPHPF follows a simple rule:

> **"As simple as possible, as flexible as necessary."**

Please keep this in mind when proposing changes.  
We want to keep the core minimal, readable, and extensible — without adding unnecessary abstractions or complexity.

## 💡 Suggestions & Issues

If you have a feature idea or found a bug:
- Open an issue in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nixphp/framework/issues)
- Be as specific as possible
- Screenshots or code examples help a lot

---

## 🔧 Pull Requests

When submitting a PR:

- Keep changes focused and clean
- Avoid large architectural rewrites
- Don't introduce third-party dependencies unless discussed
- Use native PHP wherever possible

If in doubt — open an issue first to discuss your idea.

## 📁 Project Structure

The framework consists of:

- `src/Core/` — central framework logic (router, dispatcher, etc.)
- `src/Support/` — utility classes and helpers
- `src/Resources/` — internal views and templates
- `src/Exceptions/` — custom exception classes
- `functions.php` — globally available general functions
- `view_helpers.php` — view-specific helper functions

All code is PSR-4 autoloaded via Composer.

---

## 🧪 Tests

Unit tests are planned — contributions in that area are also welcome.

# Introduction

Welcome to **NixPHP** — a minimalist, modern PHP microframework.

NixPHP is built for developers who want:

- Full control over their application's structure
- Minimal dependencies and maximum flexibility
- Native PHP strengths combined with modern standards (PSR-3, PSR-4, PSR-7, PSR-11, PSR-18)

It provides essential features like routing, controller dispatching, view rendering, database access, session handling, and smart response handling — without unnecessary overhead.

Use NixPHP as a lightweight foundation for APIs, web applications, or any PHP project that values **clarity**, **speed**, and **simplicity**.
